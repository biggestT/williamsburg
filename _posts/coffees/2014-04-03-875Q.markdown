text-en: Only grown between altitudes of 1875-2200m in the Sidama region of Ethiopia, this 87 Q score coffee marries a very well balanced brown sugar sweetness and a syrupy body with tones of soft stoned fruits.  Its substantial mouth-feel and good acidity make this an excellent coffee and we are honoured to be able to feature this coffee in our current offer.
