A three floored venue, with a rooftop terrace, secret stairways and more hidden secret stairways, you´ll have fun just trying to find the second floor. Creamy lattes with hints of almondy amaretto work perfectly with their durian cake. We´re serious. You can also buy our coffee there, whole bean or ground. 

Located on one of our favourite streets in Shanghai!
