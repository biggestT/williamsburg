#Where it all started

##Our history


Specialty coffee was born in Williamsburg, New York. Williamsburg Coffee Roasters, now based in Shanghai aim to bring specialty coffee and culture to this city. Importing Q graded green bean Single-Origins from around the world, we then roast locally and on demand.
