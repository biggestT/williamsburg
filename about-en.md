Specialty coffee was born in Williamsburg, New York. Williamsburg Coffee Roasters, now based in Shanghai aim to bring specialty coffee and culture to this city. Importing Q graded green bean Single-Origins from around the world, we then roast locally and on demand. 


Selling to various restaurants, caf√©s and hotels in Shanghai we create distinct premium blends that adapt to consumer taste. We also specialize in supplying/renting coffee machines, coffee machine maintenance and staff training. Contact us below for your personalized coffee package.
